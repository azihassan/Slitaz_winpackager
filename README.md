Slitaz package downloader for Windows

For users who can't (yet) get their internet connection to work on Slitaz, but are still looking for a tolerable way to download packages with their respective dependencies on Windows. This script takes a package name and scraps the official website for a list of links, then downloads them while displaying a real time progress status.

Arguments :

	--package : specifies the name of the package to download.
	--dependencies : if this parameter is indicated, the script will download the dependencies of the package instead of the package itself.
	--overwrite : the script will overwrite any existing packages.
	--path : the path where the downloaded packages will be saved.
	--nocache : the script will download the source of the webpage instead of using one from the temp directory (if available).
	--help : prints the usage.
